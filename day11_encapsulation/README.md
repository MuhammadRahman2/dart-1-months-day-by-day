# 1. What is Encapsulation?
Encapsulation means hiding internal details and controlling how data is accessed or changed.
Itâ€™s like putting your data inside a box and only giving specific ways to open it.

In Dart, we do this using:

Private variables (start with _)

Getters and Setter

*Role & Purpose*

Protects the data from being modified directly.

Allows validation before changing data.

Makes your code clean, secure, and easy to maintai
